1*Beef Brisket*3 to 4 lbs of a brisket cut of beef, 3/4 cup barbeque sauce, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 cup of water*Preheat oven to 300ºF. In a bowl, mix together the barbeque sauce, soy sauce, and water. Place the brisket roast on a large piece of aluminum foil. Spread the BBQ sauce mixture generously over meat. Wrap the brisket in aluminum foil and place it in a roasting pan. Bake for 1 hour for every 1 pound of meat. Place the barbecue sauce and the brisket in an oven roasting bag. Sprinkle a teaspoon of flour into the bag. Poke a couple small holes in the bag. Place the bag in a roasting pan. You may find that the cooking time is faster with this method, or you can reduce the oven temperature to 275°F. Remove from oven and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes before serving*
